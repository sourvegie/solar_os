# Firmware Packages and Flavors

SolarOS package selection is declared in `packages/solar_os_packages.toml`.
Flavor files select groups or individual packages; the generator resolves
package dependencies and then removes packages unsupported by the target board.

`service.streams` owns the dynamic typed endpoint registry. Sensor, port, and
audio providers register their endpoints there at runtime. `service.audio`
also owns audio-device discovery; devices refer to their capture and playback
stream IDs instead of exposing a board-specific global data path. It has no
board-audio capability requirement. `service.audio-board` publishes built-in
board endpoints and retains the hardware capability gate. The independent
`service.audio-codecs` package owns incremental compressed-audio decoding, so
file players and network sources can share the same decoder without owning an
audio device.

`expansion.audio-pwm` depends on the generic audio and expansion services, not
on `service.audio-board`. On a board with expansion PWM it can therefore add a
runtime playback device even when no built-in codec or DAC exists.
`expansion.pcm5102` follows the same ownership model on boards with the
`expansion_i2s` capability and adds an I2S playback device without requiring
built-in audio. That capability guarantees a spare I2S controller and at least
three runtime-safe output GPIOs, so the package is pruned from boards such as
ODROID-GO that cannot expose all required signals.
`expansion.ssd1683` reuses the 400x300 SSD1683 controller implementation with a
named SPI bus and runtime-claimed CS, D/C, reset, and BUSY pins. It registers an
auxiliary display target and uses changed-frame partial windows in automatic
mode; it does not replace or suspend a built-in display.
`expansion.cardkb` polls the M5Stack Unit CardKB at its fixed I2C address and
publishes its character taps and navigation keys through the shared input
service used by shells and foreground apps.
`expansion.sdspi` adds removable SPI microSD storage to boards that do not have
built-in SD hardware. It uses a named expansion SPI bus and mounts at
`/sdcard` without changing the internal-flash root filesystem.

## Ownership Rules

- `bootstrap` is immutable and contains only the runtime and shell needed to
  start SolarOS. A flavor cannot disable its members.
- Groups are selection shortcuts only. They cannot own source files or ESP-IDF
  component requirements.
- Every source file and component requirement belongs to a package.
- A package lists other packages it needs with `depends`. Enabling an app or job
  automatically enables its transitive dependencies. Explicitly disabling a
  required package is an error.
- Board capability pruning is applied to the resolved graph. If a dependency is
  unavailable, its dependants are removed as well.

The standard selectors are `system`, `expansions`, `maintenance_apps`,
`maintenance_jobs`, `hardware_jobs`, `audio`, `net`, `agent`, `media`, `games`,
`retro`, `python`, `lua`, `writing`, and `utils`. Maintenance jobs contain
background logging and battery monitoring. Hardware jobs contain Bridge, DAQ,
GPIO Keys, and SUMP for hardware diagnostics and hacking. The `writing` group contains
Reader, Writer, Files, and Notes; general utilities contain Clock, Calculator,
Plot, Logic, and Sheet.

The `retro` flavor is the full firmware plus experimental emulation packages.
Its `retro` group currently selects `app.gameboy`, which requires graphics,
PSRAM, and SD storage. When `service.synth` is present, Game Boy also uses the
MiniGB APU through the shared synth and audio services.

The `writerdeck` flavor targets the Elecrow e-paper board with the `writing`
group plus system, maintenance, and network tools. It excludes general
utilities and hardware-diagnostics jobs to stay focused and fit the board's
smaller OTA slot.

The `rover`, `rover-python`, and `rover-lua` flavors target the Freenove
ESP32-WROVER v3.0 composite-video terminal. All three include the expansion
framework and drivers, networking, media viewing, general utilities, Files,
the log job, Bridge, and the GPIO Keys job. The base `rover` flavor also
includes the remaining writing applications. They omit the battery monitor
because the board has no battery hardware, and omit the DAQ and SUMP jobs by
default. The Logic app is also omitted because its timing-sensitive capture
buffer requires more internal-memory margin than this configuration provides.
`rover` includes games and has no embedded interpreter;
`rover-python` and `rover-lua` omit games, Reader, Writer, and Notes, and add
only their selected scripting stack. Agent remains excluded because its runtime
memory requirements exceed the practical internal-memory margin. The board's
4 MB flash uses one large factory application slot, so these flavors omit OTA
and remote manual synchronization. The embedded `docs` application remains
available.

`rover-synth` is a focused classic-ESP32 synthesizer build. It retains BLE and
PS/2 keyboard input, SD and basic file tools, controls, MIDI, and the LEDC PWM
audio expansion while omitting Wi-Fi/networking, packet radio, media, games,
scripting, and unrelated application groups. Composite video owns I2S0, so the
on-board audio package remains disabled and Synth uses a runtime-attached PWM
output. This smaller profile preserves Bluetooth controller memory headroom.

`rover-retro` is a focused Freenove Game Boy build with the normal system
service baseline. It includes BLE keyboard input, SD storage, UART ports,
hardware I/O services, filesystem commands, Docs, Edit, Less, Com, Files, the
log job, Bridge, GPIO Keys, Wi-Fi, and the SSH/SCP clients. It excludes the remaining
network stack, expansion drivers, media, the rest of the writing suite,
utilities, other games, scripting, and OTA. The Freenove board has no usable
audio backend while
composite scanout owns I2S0, so Game Boy runs without MiniGB APU or synth output
in this flavor.

Network ownership is intentionally split. `network.base`, `network.wireguard`, `network.mqtt`,
`network.ssh`, `network.mail`, `messaging.gateway`, `network.http-client`, and
`network.http-server` own their individual implementations. Image and document
decoding are separate `media.image` and `media.document` packages, so selecting
`app.curl`, for example, does not pull MQTT, SSH, mail, or image dependencies.

`network.wireguard` depends directly on `service.wifi` and lwIP. It owns the
native tunnel, its bounded route table, the lwIP route hook, persistent client
profile, Wi-Fi address-event handling, and light-sleep lifecycle. It is not part
of either embedded scripting runtime.

`network.http-client` owns the shared TLS-enabled HTTP transport used by `curl`,
`webradio`, and `web`. It exposes request headers and bodies, redirects,
streaming response events, cross-task cancellation, per-I/O timeouts, and an
end-to-end deadline.
Callers continue to own their worker task and response consumer; see
[HTTP Client Service](../http_client.md) for the native API and lifecycle.

`service.webradio` owns the disk-backed user station catalog on the current
storage root. `app.webradio`
combines that catalog with the shared HTTP client, MP3 codec, generic audio
output service, and `service.signal-widgets`. The signal-widget package owns
reusable signed-16-bit oscilloscope and DSP spectrum components; it depends on
`service.dsp`, whose eligible ESP32-S3 FFT path uses PIE SIMD. WebRadio requires
Wi-Fi but does not require the board-audio capability: a headless board can
include the app and later gain a default audio output from a runtime-attached
expansion. The foreground app owns separate network/decode and steady playback
workers joined by a PSRAM-preferred PCM jitter buffer. Suspending its UI leaves
those workers running; closing the app stops them and releases their resources.

`app.player` combines the shared audio and codec services with a persistent
playlist on the current storage root, the reusable storage browser, signal
widgets, and the reusable cassette widget. Its file browser selects existing
WAV/MP3 files. Player has no built-in-audio capability requirement, so a
runtime-attached output device can satisfy playback.

`app.recorder` is the interactive counterpart to `arecord`. It combines the
generic audio and stream services with the same storage browser, cassette,
oscilloscope, and spectrum packages as Player. It records PCM WAV from a
runtime-selected capture stream and does not require built-in board audio.
Its monitor transport loops the selected capture stream to the current default
output and visualization widgets without opening a recording file. Recorder
allocates its app-lifetime state in PSRAM on PSRAM boards and releases it when
the application closes. Its browser, widgets, conversion buffers, and PCM queue
also use PSRAM. Its 8 KiB capture/file worker and the reusable audio-player
sink are admitted as user-started foreground transports with internal stacks,
and continue while the Recorder UI is suspended. Capture and sink timing, plus
cache-disabled filesystem access, therefore do not depend on a PSRAM stack.
Recorder stores its selected input, destination folder, format, device gain,
volume, and visualizer under `.recorder` on the current storage root. Its
cassette animates only for record and playback; scope and spectrum continue to
present monitored input at the app's nominal 25 Hz graphical cadence.
Hardware input gain is exposed through an optional audio-device operation;
streams without a gain-capable owning device remain valid recording inputs and
show gain as unavailable.

`app.funcgen` combines `service.synth` with the shared oscilloscope widget.
It has no built-in-audio capability requirement and discovers runtime output
devices when opened. Its foreground and widget state prefer PSRAM; the bounded
oscillator state and Synth worker remain internal for deterministic rendering.
Every displayed control has a corresponding native parameter for physical and
MIDI control bindings.

The `agent` group selects `app.agent` and its `service.agent` dependency.
`service.agent` owns provider-neutral events, NVS-backed provider
configuration, bounded tool-loop policy, a declarative typed-tool registry,
and the OpenAI Responses/Chat-Completions adapter. The registry owns provider
schemas, output schemas, risk and availability metadata, and shared execution
for the system, storage, jobs, and policy-gated script tools. Its NVS-backed
`off`, `readonly`, `confirm`, and `all` policy filters advertised schemas and
is enforced again at execution time.
It depends on the shared HTTP and JSON services and is pruned from targets
without both Wi-Fi and PSRAM. Python and Lua are not dependencies. See
[Native Agent Service](agent.md).

`app.python` and `app.lua` each depend on `service.script_runner`. That service
defines the common source/file request, bounded output, cancellation, deadline,
and completion-status contract. Each interpreter owns its language adapter and
single-owner guard. `app.agent` supplies installed adapters to both the manual
`agent script` command and the typed agent registry without making either
interpreter a dependency of the agent package.

Messaging is split into explicit layers: `service.messaging` owns
provider-neutral conversations, history, delivery state, and the pending
outbox; `messaging.gateway` owns gateway configuration and room commands;
`chat.transport.gateway` owns the gateway wire protocol; and
`job.gateway-sync` owns connection lifetime, retries, cursors, and gateway
delivery. The bounded store persists full messages on SD and uses the
Inbox's compact persistent records as its internal-flash fallback. Stable
producer IDs suppress transport replays before they reach either UI. `app.chat`
depends only on the provider-neutral Messaging service and is a foreground view
over that shared state; `job.chatd` remains the
independent local gateway server.

Inbox storage and presentation are also separate. Producers such as mail and
POCSAG depend only on `service.inbox`; it owns the bounded persistent ring under
`/.inbox/`, durable read state, producer-key replay suppression, and the
persisted opt-in notification-sound policy. Audio-capable builds enqueue the
sound through `service.audio`; Inbox remains available without audio hardware.
`app.inbox` adds the foreground browser and its shell command.

`service.synth` depends on the device-independent `service.audio` and provides
exclusive real-time PCM rendering for reusable synthesizers and emulated sound
hardware. It opens the default playback endpoint at runtime, so firmware
without built-in board audio can use a subsequently attached output expansion.
The selected audio provider retains hardware-codec, global-volume, and
output-serialization ownership; the synth service owns a bounded render block,
dedicated worker, client ownership, and deadline/error counters. Native apps
can supply an independent signed 16-bit stereo render callback.

## Custom Flavor Example

This flavor adds only `curl` and the dependency closure needed by that app to
the immutable bootstrap:

```toml
[flavor]
name = "curl-only"
description = "Bootstrap plus the HTTP client app."

[packages]
app_curl = true
```

Use `pkg` on the device to inspect the resolved package list.

## Quick reference

Packages are the actual build units, groups are convenience bundles, and a
flavor selects packages for a board. Board capabilities remove packages that
cannot run. Use `pkg` on-device to inspect the resolved firmware and edit a
flavor TOML file when producing a custom build.
